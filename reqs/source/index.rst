Welcome to **Pussla** – a "Planning-as-Code" system. We built this because humans aren't rows in an Excel sheet, and resource planning shouldn't be a nightmare. With this you can manage 100+ colleagues using the same tools you use to build software: **Git, Markdown, and YAML.**

🇸🇪 The "Pussla" Philosophy

1. **Planning-as-Code:** If it's not in Git, it didn't happen.
2. **Context Matters:** Numbers tell us *what*, but Markdown tells us *why*.
3. **Privacy by Design:** We protect our people's data while staying AI-ready.
4. **Lagom is Best:** Not too little data, not too much—just enough to keep the projects moving.
