## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_workflow_overview()` tool to load the tool-oriented overview (it lists the matching guide tools).

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and completion
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.

## Way of Working (WoW)

Canonical WoW document: `docs/way-of-working.md`.

- Requirements are added and tracked with Sphinx-needs in `reqs/`.
- Stories, to-do items, and implementation work are tracked in Backlog.md in `backlog/`.
- Documentation and design decisions are maintained in `docs/`.
- `README.md` stays high-level and links to deeper documentation.
